The truth is, no one has everything, but everyone has something!
Use what you have, for what you have is more than enough. No matter how little you think it is, start with it, more will be added as you go along the way.
Life is not always the way you wish it should be, it is just the way it is. Rather than complain about what you don't have, use what you find, use what's in your hands, make the best use of what you have now and here.
Start where you are, with all you have, to do what you can. Your excuses for not doing anything may be valid, but it will never be a good enough reason to do nothing or aim for anything less than greatness.
It's not always about what you've got but how you use it that makes the biggest difference.
The little you have today can become the plenty people admire tomorrow, but what you do with that little in your hands, will to a large extent determine if you will ever have the plenty you desire
